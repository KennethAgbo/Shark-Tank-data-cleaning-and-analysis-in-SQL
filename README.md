DATA CLEANING AND ANALYSIS ON SHARK TANK DATASET IN SQL AND POWER BI
In this project,  my objective is to find the relationship and trend existing among variables which will aid investment decision making in Shark tank. 

Overall, I worked with a Shark Tank dataset with over 50 columns from the period, 2009 to 2019.  I explore the dataset in SQL  using: DESCRIBE  data; 
I inspected and cleaned the data by ensuring that all the variables have the right datatypes and also updated the missing values. Both data cleaning and data analysis were performed on SQL while visualization is in Power BI. I created two dashboards (Pitchers, and Sharks ).

Shark Tank is an American business reality television series that premiered on August  9, 2009, on American  Broadcasting Company (ABC). It is a popular reality show in which wealthy investors valuate startups who pitch for funding.  The investors (Sharks) use several valuation techniques to debunk or concur with the owner's(Pitchers') valuation and decide whether to grant them funding in return for an ownership stake.

The analyses show that out of 531 Pitchers only 286 pitchers secured a deal with the Sharks. And the total amount invested by Sharks is 81.59M while total equity received by Sharks is 8.13K. Furthermore, Pitchers' dashboard illustrates how Food and Beverage is the most represented industry and Automotive industries received the highest average deal valuation. Ethan Tucker and Pat Boone(Multiple Pitchers) is the entrepreneur that secured the largest deal in Shark Tank. On the other hand, I used scatter chart in Sharks Dashboard to capture the trend existing between Sum of Valuation Requested and Sum of Deal Valuation. It shows a positive relationship. This means that the higher the   Sum of Valuation Requested, the higher the Sum of Deal Valuation. I also observed that the  Sum of Valuation Requested as shown on the scatter chart is always greater than the Sum of Deal Valuation in the Shark Tank. Consequently, this will aid sharks in making improved investment decisions.

My special appreciation goes to Kazeem Musbau for his guidance and support as I continue my internship in Lagos School of Programming (LASOP)
